Objective: Take a large unfocused data set containing stock ticker information and pull summary information based on the ticker symbol.  We had to get each tickers first open and final close price and create a summary table with one code block.
Challenge: The most difficult part was registering a ticker change.  This was remedied by creating a flag in the code that would update when it detected a change in the ticker label column.  
Output: Four quarterly stock reports were automatically generated each containing the symbols initial open price and final close price.
