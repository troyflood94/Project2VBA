I bounced ideas back and fourth with a friend which ultinmately is how I got my ticker working.  I also used chatGPT for some of the syntax, but largely I fed it plain english as to what I needed it to do. Getting the flag to work.  The most difficult part of this was actually getting the first open to subtract by the last close. GPT helped me figure out how to accomplish that.
