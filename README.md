Before getting syntax help, I was texting back and fourth with a friend who is an analyst named Tom Huesser, through that conversation I realized a flag ticker is going to be necessary in order ot get this to behave properly. I also used chatGPT for some of the syntax, but largely I fed it plain english as to what I needed it to do, step by step.   The most difficult part of this was actually getting the first open to subtract by the last close. GPT helped me figure out how to accomplish that.
